The message **"SQL Server is terminating in response to a 'stop' request from Service Control Manager"** typically indicates that the SQL Server service was **intentionally stopped**, either manually by an administrator, by a scheduled task, or by another system-level process such as a patch, failover, or shutdown event.

---

### üîç What This Message Means
This message corresponds to **Event ID 17148** and is classified as **informational**, not an error. It confirms that SQL Server is shutting down **gracefully** in response to a legitimate stop request from the Windows **Service Control Manager (SCM)** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-17148-database-engine-error?view=sql-server-ver16) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/troubleshooting-availability-group-failover) [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-17148-database-engine-error?view=sql-server-ver16).

### ‚úÖ Common Causes
1. **Manual Stop**: An admin stopped the SQL Server service via SQL Server Configuration Manager, Services.msc, or PowerShell.
2. **Planned Maintenance**: A patch, update, or scheduled job required the service to stop.
3. **Failover Event**: In clustered environments, the service may stop on one node and start on another during failover.
4. **Storage or I/O Issues**: If SQL Server encounters I/O stalls or storage path failures, it may shut down to preserve data integrity [4](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADM3MWViZjkzLWFlYWItNGIzNi04OWM4LWUyZDY2OGM5OTk4NwBGAAAAAAAoSXoN9mnpRpmD5edOaDm%2bBwBe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAAAAAEMAABe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAFLCjXNAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).
5. **Antivirus Interference**: AV software locking critical binaries like `sqlboot.dll` during startup can cause SQL Server to fail to restart after a stop [4](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADM3MWViZjkzLWFlYWItNGIzNi04OWM4LWUyZDY2OGM5OTk4NwBGAAAAAAAoSXoN9mnpRpmD5edOaDm%2bBwBe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAAAAAEMAABe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAFLCjXNAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Investigate
1. **Check Event Viewer**:
   - Look for **Event ID 17148** in the Application log.
   - Also check for **Event ID 7036** (service entered stopped state) or **7034** (unexpected termination) in the System log [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/troubleshooting-availability-group-failover).

2. **Review SQL Server Error Logs**:
   - Look at the tail of the error log to see what happened just before shutdown.
   - If the log ends abruptly, it may indicate a forced termination.

3. **Cluster Logs (if applicable)**:
   - If you're using Always On or Failover Clustering, check the **Cluster log** for failover events.

4. **Check for I/O or Storage Issues**:
   - Event ID 153 (Miniport driver timeout) or 129 (Storport reset) can indicate underlying disk issues [4](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADM3MWViZjkzLWFlYWItNGIzNi04OWM4LWUyZDY2OGM5OTk4NwBGAAAAAAAoSXoN9mnpRpmD5edOaDm%2bBwBe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAAAAAEMAABe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAFLCjXNAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).

5. **Validate Antivirus Exclusions**:
   - Ensure your AV solution excludes SQL Server binaries and data directories as per https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/admin/antivirus-exclusions-sql-server.

### üß© Example Root Cause (from your environment)
In one of your recent incidents, a transient I/O stall caused SQL Server to halt processing. When I/O resumed, SQL Server failed to restart due to issues loading `sqlboot.dll`, likely caused by AV interference or file corruption during the stall [4](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADM3MWViZjkzLWFlYWItNGIzNi04OWM4LWUyZDY2OGM5OTk4NwBGAAAAAAAoSXoN9mnpRpmD5edOaDm%2bBwBe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAAAAAEMAABe2sj6WL%2f2S7leS6aDxSTfAAFLCjXNAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem).
