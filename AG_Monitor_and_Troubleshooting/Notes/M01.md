## Wait statistics

### HADR_SYNC_COMMIT  

Waiting for transaction commit processing for the synchronized secondary databases to harden the log. This wait is also reflected by the Transaction Delay performance counter. This wait type is expected for synchronized availability groups and indicates the time to send, write, and acknowledge log to the secondary databases. 

### HADR_CLUSAPI_CALL 

SQL Server thread is waiting to switch from non-preemptive mode (scheduled by SQL Server) to preemptive mode (scheduled by the operating system) in order to invoke Windows Server Failover Clustering APIs. 

### HADR_LOGCAPTURE_WAIT (on the primary replica)

Waiting for log records to become available. Can occur either when waiting for new log records to be generated by connections or for I/O completion when reading log not in the cache. This is an expected wait if the log scan is caught up to the end of log or is reading from disk. 

### HADR_SYNCHRONIZING_THROTTLE 

Waiting for transaction commit processing to allow a synchronizing secondary database to catch up to the primary end of log in order to transition to the synchronized state. This is an expected wait when a secondary database is catching up. 

### WRITELOG 

Occurs while waiting for a log flush to complete. Common operations that cause log flushes are checkpoints and transaction commits.
