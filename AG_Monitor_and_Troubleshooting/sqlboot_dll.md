The error involving failure to load `sqlboot.dll` during SQL Server startup is a serious issue that typically points to corruption or interference with critical SQL Server binaries. Based on internal documentation and external sources, here are the most common causes and how to investigate them:

### üîç What Causes `sqlboot.dll` to Fail to Load?

#### 1. **Corrupted or Missing DLL**
This is the most direct cause. If `sqlboot.dll` is missing or damaged, SQL Server cannot initialize. This can happen due to:
- Incomplete or failed updates
- Disk corruption
- Antivirus or endpoint protection software quarantining or locking the file [1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/sql-server-installation-sqlbootdll/a8e47caa-e720-47d8-ba66-acd62d2ad33b) [2](https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/sql-server-error-unable-to-load-sqlboot-dll.308768/)

#### 2. **Antivirus or Endpoint Protection Interference**
Internal documentation highlights that antivirus software can lock or block access to `sqlboot.dll` or related binaries like `dbghelp.dll`, especially during startup. This is particularly common if exclusions for SQL Server directories are not properly configured [3](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DataAIPremierOfferings/Production/Maintain/POP/SQL_Server_Recovery_Execution_Service/Templates/SQLRES_Clustered_Standalone_Template_Version_5.00.00_FY19.docx?web=1).

#### 3. **File System or Disk I/O Issues**
If the disk subsystem is experiencing latency or corruption, SQL Server may fail to read critical binaries like `sqlboot.dll`. This is often accompanied by other errors such as lease timeouts or stack dump failures [4](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DataAIPremierOfferings/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8C9E4CFE-E7BF-4109-9F0D-D05B2B78229C%7D&file=M02%20-%20Failover%20Issues.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

#### 4. **Incorrect Permissions or Service Account Issues**
If the SQL Server service account lacks permissions to access the binary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\...`), it may be unable to load `sqlboot.dll` [5](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DataAIPremierOfferings/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5AD2F449-80AF-4BC5-B71C-3C5E076317C7%7D&file=SQLRES_AlwaysOn_Template_Version_5.00.00_FY19.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

#### 5. **Tampered or Incomplete Installation**
If the installation was interrupted or tampered with (e.g., by a failed patch or manual file replacement), SQL Server may detect this and refuse to start [1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/sql-server-installation-sqlbootdll/a8e47caa-e720-47d8-ba66-acd62d2ad33b) [2](https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/sql-server-error-unable-to-load-sqlboot-dll.308768/).

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Investigate and Resolve

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Event Viewer and SQL Error Logs
Look for entries around the time of failure. You may see:
- `Event ID 17182` or `17183`
- Messages about `sqlboot.dll` or `dbghelp.dll` not found

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Verify File Integrity
Check if `sqlboot.dll` exists in:
```
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQLXX.<InstanceName>\MSSQL\Binn\
```
If missing or corrupted, consider copying it from a healthy server with the same build.

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Check Antivirus Logs
Ensure your AV is not blocking or quarantining SQL Server binaries. Add exclusions for:
- SQL Server binary folders
- Data and log directories
- TempDB and backup paths

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Repair or Reinstall SQL Server
If the file is missing or corrupted and cannot be restored:
- Run SQL Server setup and choose **Repair**.
- If repair fails, uninstall and reinstall the instance [1](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/sql-server-installation-sqlbootdll/a8e47caa-e720-47d8-ba66-acd62d2ad33b) [2](https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/sql-server-error-unable-to-load-sqlboot-dll.308768/).

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Validate Disk Health
Use tools like `chkdsk`, `sfc /scannow`, or vendor-specific diagnostics to ensure the disk is healthy.
